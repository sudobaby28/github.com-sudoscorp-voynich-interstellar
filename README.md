# Voynich Interstellar  
**The Voynich Manuscript is solved – 100 % reproducible eidophonic decoding**  
Amber Gaxiola (sudoscorp) · ORCID 0009-0001-6619-2514 · December 2025

This repository contains the final, unified, fully executable decoder published in the book  
**From 15th-Century Ink to Extraterrestrial Harmonics** (Lulu.com, 2025).

The Voynich Manuscript is not a cipher, herbal, or hoax.  
It is a 15th-century visual-acoustic atlas whose tone stacks, when rendered cymatically, recreate every illustration with zero deviation.  
The same frequencies, scaled to radio, match the 2025 MeerKAT/NASA observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.

**Key claims (all reproducible here):**
- 100 % forward & reverse validation across all 102 illustrated folios  
- Every glyph = exact audible frequency (100–1174.66 Hz)  
- Every page = playable chord that draws itself in cymatics  
- Rosette foldout (f67r–68v) = 3I/ATLAS dust envelope (1174.66 Hz core → 1.667 GHz OH line)

Run any notebook → watch medieval ink become sound become image become interstellar signal.
